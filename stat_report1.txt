1. What we did this week
         - Used bootstrap to create the basic design of the quiz page. We have our
           layout with questions and buttons such that the user experience is
           prepared but we need to fill in the appropriate questions and connect
           it to javascript

2. Challenges that happened this week
         - Getting bootstrap radio buttons and button groups to work
         - Getting the quiz page to size well based on user's browser size

3. Goals for next week
         - Learn how to fork for git
         - Get some of the audio files prepared
         - Learn to make buttons/radios/forms in bootstrap interact with our
           javascript and save data to local storage
         - Create separate pages for opening/intro page and our results/data
           page
         - Pick an API
         - Create a javascript file for the quiz page
         - Learn how condense MP3s
