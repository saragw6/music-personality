1. What we did this week
    - Added some of our sound files
    - Added javascript to our allquestions page
    - Made the page start to interact with the user instead of just being static
    - Prepared outcomes of user interaction with questions so that we can extract
      information from what the user selects and prevent them from changing their
      responses in the way that we want.

2. Challenges that happened this week
    - Getting the javascript to interact properly
    - Recognizing our buttons needed to be changed into radio inputs in order
      to successfully get information from them in the way that we want.
      Specifically, this was in order to pass the information of which button
      (answer) was selected, which was troublesome with our previous format in
      which only the information of “Submit” was passed.

3. Goals for next week
    - Create rest of the sound files
    - Get a working set of questions (can do after all sound files prepared)
    - Work on interaction with local storage
    - Get javascript to play sound on question selection instead of just alert
    - Create separate pages for opening/intro page and our results page
    - Make questions' javascript more modular?
    - Start thinking about storing/sharing/presenting data on quiz results
